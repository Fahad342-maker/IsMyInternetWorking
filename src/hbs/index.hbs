            DNS is usually provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), but you can try a different DNS provider by (temporarily)
            <a

                work (which is an IP address and should not require a DNS lookup), then it's unlikely a DNS issue.

            What can I do to make my connection faster?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Your Internet connection's maximum bandwidth is ultimately dictated by your ISP, but if you're not reaching that limit, there are a number of strategies
            you can employ to make your connection faster. Wireless signals can be improved by simply physically relocating closer to the access point.
            Better hardware can also improve signal and connection strength: an <a href="http://amzn.to/2nKnZGk" target="_blank">802.11 AC Wifi Router</a> or
            <a href="http://amzn.to/2sf2Ys0" target="_blank">range extender</a>, when paired with an <a href="http://amzn.to/2sih5wv" target="_blank">802.11 AC Wifi Adapter</a>,
            can offer significant improvements in range and bandwidth over older generations of Wifi. For immediate improvements,

            <ul class="bodylist">
                <li>Pause or stop any active downloads or applications that could be hogging bandwidth.</li>
                <li>Make sure the hotspot you are connecting to is secured - refer to your router's manual on how to set up a
                    password (using <b>WPA2</b> encryption, not WEP, which is unsafe). Unsecured networks can be accessed by just about anybody, clogging up available bandwidth.</li>
                <li>Restart your Wifi adapter by turning it on and off, or unplugging it and plugging it back in.
                <li>Restart your router manually by unplugging it and plugging it back in after 30 seconds. Sometimes routers
                    just need a fresh reboot to get things going again.</li>

            Any one of the components that bridge your computer to the internet could be broken, so you'll may have to diagnose each one
            individually. If your hardware configuration hasn't changed recently, it could very well be a software issue. Listed below are some potential fixes
            for temporary software problems that can get you back on track.

                <li>Restart your computer. No, really! On both wireless and wired connections, this will force your router to re-assign
                    dynamic IP address to your computer.

                <li>Connect to a different wireless hotspot, such as one created by your smartphone through tethering. Failure

            Try to access your router's control panel via your browser (192.168.*.*) on a wired connection. In the table above, you can
            find control panel IP addresses for common router manufacturers under the "IP Address" column. Alternatively,
            you can find it in your router's manual. Type the IP address into the address bar of your browser, press enter, and the control panel page should appear.
            If the IP address of your router is not listed above or doesn't work, try the following:

            If the control panel says something similar to "Searching for Server" or "First-time Setup", then your ISP is having issues.
            Consider <a href="http://gethuman.com/" target="_blank">giving them a call</a> to see if they are aware of connectivity problems on their end.
            A support number can be located on your latest internet bill. Otherwise, if the control panel page never loads (with no login
            prompt), and you're absolutely certain about the address, consider trying another router. This is
            rather time consuming, but can determine if your router is at fault or your ISP is at fault.
        <p class="answer">Online, or at your local electronics store, you can find fully capable routers ranging anywhere from <a href="http://amzn.to/2smzdpc" target="_blank">cheap</a> to <a href="http://amzn.to/2CbqnKD" target="_blank">expensive.</a>
            If a brand new router fails to connect as well, the issue is likely due to your ISP and your router(s) are perfectly fine. If the new one connects, your
            old router is having problems, you can stick with your newly purchased one (or return it for a

            Warning: This operation is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">irrevocable</span> and your old router settings will be permanently deleted, so we recommend
            one more series of reboots before attempting a reset. Begin by locating the reset button on your router, which may be underneath or in the back, and will likely

        <p class="question">I've tried everything above and I still don't have a stable connection!</p>
        <p class="answer">
            No amount of restarting and updating can make up for a poor quality connection provided by your ISP. Temporary setbacks are usually resolved within a day or two,
            but if you continue to experience regular disconnects, consider switching to a different ISP.
